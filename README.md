My ML Portfolio

This portfolio is being made to demonstrate understanding and mastery of using machine learning professionally.

Most of what is in the portfolio now are base codes copy/pasted from various sources that I plan to use as foundation to build my own approaches. Please disregard those which are still in development. I will continue on this in Early April of 2019.

Projects YelpReviews and Semantic Classificaiton have codes in a way that I typically comment/write code.
