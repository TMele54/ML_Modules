My ML Portfolio

This portfolio is being made to demonstrate understanding and mastery of using machine learning professionally.

A lot of what is int he portfolio now are based codes copy pasted from various sources that I plan to use as foundation to build my own approaches. Please disregard those which are still in development.

Project YelpReviews or Semantic Classificaiton have codes in a way that I typically comment code.
